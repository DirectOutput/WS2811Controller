# WS2811 Controller
Source Code for the Atmel based WS2811 controller.

This is just old code and board designs which I found on my backup disks. There are 3 different version of the code and several versions of the board design. Cant say for sure if one of them is any good or which one that would be. 

The assembly code was written in Ateml Studio. The boards where made with Eagle.

Feel free to use it in any way you like. Unfortunately, I cant really help with questions, since I have not touched all this for the last 8 years.
