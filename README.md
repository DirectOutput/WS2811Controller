# WS2811 Controller
Source Code for the Atmel based WS2811 controller.

This is just old code and board designs which I found on my backup disks. There are 3 different version of the code and several versions of the board design. In some directories there are a few word and pdf files that explain some of the details. Cant say for sure if some of all this any good and what that would be. 

The assembly code was written in Atmel Studio. The boards where made with Eagle.

Feel free to use it in any way you like. Unfortunately, I cant really help with questions, since I have not touched all this for the last 8 years.
